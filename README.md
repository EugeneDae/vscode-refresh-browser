Refresh your web-browser with a ⌘R shortcut without switching from VS Code. **Only works on macOS!**

**🔥 NEW FEATURE IN VERSION 1.1.0:** enable `refreshBrowser.runBuildTask` setting if you want to run the build task of your project before refreshing the browser.

## FAQ

- **Why macOS only?** This extension relies on AppleScript to communicate with the browser.

- **Which browsers are supported?** Safari, Chrome and Chromium-based browsers, such as Edge, Opera etc. Firefox is not supported, because it lacks the AppleScript API. For Firefox and other browsers, use [@fabiospampinatoʼs Browser Refresh](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-browser-refresh) extension.

- **How is this extension different to [@fabiospampinatoʼs Browser Refresh](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-browser-refresh)?** Refresh Browser (this extension) communicates with the browser directly via the browserʼs AppleScript API. For this reason:

    - it works slightly faster;
    - Code always stays in focus;
    - it can find a tab to refresh by URL (configure this behavior using the `refreshBrowser.findTabByUrlStartingWith` setting).

    At the same time, it has limited browser support and is unable to send a “force refresh” command to the browser.

    [@fabiospampinatoʼs Browser Refresh](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-browser-refresh) uses AppleScript to simulate the ⌘R keystroke in the browser window, resulting in Code window losing focus for a fraction of a second. Such method has its advantages: it can be used to simulate the “force refresh” keystroke (Cmd-Shift-R), and it is more universal in terms of browser support.

- **I need “force refresh”. What can I do?** Keep your browser console always open and disable caching.

## Installation

[Click **Install** on the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dae.vscode-refresh-browser), or run from the command palette (Cmd-Shift-P):

```
ext install dae.vscode-refresh-browser
```

## Usage

Press Cmd-R or run `Refresh Browser` from the command palette (Cmd-Shift-P).

Command ID: `extension.refreshBrowser`

## Settings

```javascript
{
    "refreshBrowser.browser": "Google Chrome", // the browser to refresh
    "refreshBrowser.urlPrefixes": [] // refresh the tab whose URL starts with one of the specified prefixes
    "refreshBrowser.runBuildTask": false // if enabled, run the build task and wait for its completion before refreshing the browser (if the build task is not available, simply refresh the browser)
}
```

A note regarding `refreshBrowser.urlPrefixes`: if you add `https://localhost`, a tab whose URL is `https://localhost/website/index.html` will be refreshed. If there are multiple tabs with matching URLs, only the first one will be refreshed. If there are no tabs with a matching URL, the active tab will be refreshed.
